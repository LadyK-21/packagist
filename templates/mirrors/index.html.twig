<p>Packagist.org package metadata is hosted on the Bunny.net CDN to meet demand from the Composer user base. Their <a href="https://bunny.net/network/">global network</a> should ensure good latency and speed for almost all Composer users.</p>
<p>In the event that you experience issues however, you may try the following mirrors. These mirrors are unafiliated with us, community run and as such they might be considered an additional security risk as the metadata that Composer downloads tells it where to download code from.</p>
<p>AGAIN, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
